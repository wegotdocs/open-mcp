# OpenMCP

## Getting started

There are more than 100 OpenMCP servers, each in its own directory in [./servers](./servers/). Each server can be added to your MCP client with a one-liner:

```bash
npx @open-mcp/{server_id} add-to-client /path/to/client/config.json
```

Alternatively you can add the server details to your config manually. See the individual server READMEs for more info.

## Creating a server

Adding to the OpenMCP registry is as simple as pasting a link to an OpenAPI specification here:
