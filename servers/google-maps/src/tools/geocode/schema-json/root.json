The API follows the ISO standard for defining countries, and the filtering works best when using the corresponding ISO code of the country.\n  <aside class=\"note\"><strong>Note</strong>: If you receive unexpected results with a country code, verify that you are using a code which includes the countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest you intend. You can find code information at Wikipedia: List of ISO 3166 country codes or the ISO Online Browsing Platform.</aside>\n  \nThe following components may be used to influence results, but will not be enforced:\n\n* `route` matches the long or short name of a route.\n* `locality` matches against `locality` and `sublocality` types.\n* `administrative_area` matches all the `administrative_area` levels.\n  \nNotes about component filtering:\n\n* Do not repeat these component filters in requests, or the API will return `INVALID_REQUEST`: \n  * `country`\n  * `postal_code`\n  * `route`\n* If the request contains repeated component filters, the API evaluates those filters as an AND, not an OR.\n* Results are consistent with Google Maps, which occasionally yields unexpected `ZERO_RESULTS` responses. Using Place Autocomplete may provide better results in some use cases. To learn more, see [this FAQ](https://developers..google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/faq#trbl_component_filtering).\n* For each address component, either specify it in the address parameter or in a components filter, but not both. Specifying the same values in both may result in `ZERO_RESULTS`.\n\n<div class=\"note\">Note: At least one of `address` or `components` is required.</div>",
