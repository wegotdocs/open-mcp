These constraints apply:\n\n- If the target Linode is in a placement group, it will be removed from it when migrating.\n- The target placement group needs to be in the same `region` you're migrating to.\n- The target placement group needs to have capacity. Run the [Get a region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-region) operation for the region you want to migrate to, and store the `maximum_linodes_per_pg` value. Run the [Get a placement group](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-placement-group) operation for that same region to review how many Linodes are in that group.",
