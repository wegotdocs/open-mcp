Consider these points when cloning:\n\n- If the Linode you're cloning exists in a placement group, the API won't automatically add the cloned instance to the same placement group. You need to specify a placement group to add the clone to.\n- The target placement group needs to be in the same `region` set for this Linode.\n- The placement group needs to have capacity. Run the [Get a region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-region) operation and store the `maximum_linodes_per_pg` value to know the Linode limit per placement group. You can then run the [Get a placement group](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-placement-group) operation to review the Linodes in that group.",
