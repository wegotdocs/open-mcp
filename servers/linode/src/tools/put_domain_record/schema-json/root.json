If a subdomain is entered, it is automatically used with the Domain.\nTo configure for a different domain, enter a valid FQDN. For example, the value `www` with a Domain for\n`example.com` results in a target set to `www.example.com`, whereas the value `sample.com` results in a\ntarget set to `sample.com`. Required.\n\n`CAA`: The value. For `issue` or `issuewild` tags, the domain of your certificate issuer. For the `iodef`\ntag, a contact or submission URL (domain, http, https, or mailto). Requirements depend on the tag for this record:\n\n  - `issue`: The domain of your certificate issuer. Must include a valid domain. May include additional parameters separated with semicolons (`;`), for example: `www.example.com; foo=bar`\n  - `issuewild`: The domain of your wildcard certificate issuer. Must be a valid domain and must not start with an asterisk (`*`).\n  - `iodef`: Must be either (1) a valid domain, (2) a valid domain prepended with `http://` or `https://`, or (3) a valid email address prepended with `mailto:`.\n\n`PTR`: Required.
