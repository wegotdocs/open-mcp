In this case, a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For all other institutions, as well as for depository accounts at Capital One (including all checking and savings accounts) this field is ignored and real-time balance information will be fetched.\n\nIf this field is not ignored, and no acceptable balance is available, an `INVALID_RESULT` error with the code `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned."
