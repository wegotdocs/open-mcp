All verification steps enabled in the associated Identity Verification Template will still be run. Verification steps will either be run immediately, or once the user completes the `accept_tos` step, depending on the value provided to the `gave_consent` field.\nIf you are not using the shareable URL feature, you can optionally provide these fields via `/link/token/create` instead; both `/identity_verification/create` and `/link/token/create` are valid ways to provide this information. Note that if you provide a non-`null` user data object via `/identity_verification/create`, any user data fields entered via `/link/token/create` for the same `client_user_id` will be ignored when prefilling Link.</property-description>",
