The Signal API assumes the settlement will occur on the same business day if the `/signal/schedule` request is submitted by 6:00 PM UTC. Note: The actual cutoff time can vary depending on your payment processor or ODFI. NACHA has established three processing windows for Same Day ACH (UTC): 2:30 PM, 6:45 PM, and 8:45 PM.\n\n`STANDARD_ACH`: Standard ACH (as defined by Nacha), typically settled one to three business days after submission.\n\n`REAL_TIME_PAYMENTS`: Real-time payments via Request for Payment through networks such as RTP (The Clearing House) and FedNow, where the consumer can authorize the payment in response to a RFP, and the transaction is processed and settled immediately.\n\n`DEBIT_CARD`: Payments processed over debit card networks, leveraging the card-based infrastructure for real-time or near-real-time settlement.\n\n`MULTIPLE_PAYMENT_METHODS`: Indicates that there is no default debit rail or multiple payment methods are available, and the transaction could use any of them based on customer policy or availability."
