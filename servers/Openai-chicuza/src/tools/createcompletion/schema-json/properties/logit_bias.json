  "description": "Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.\n\nAccepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.\n\nAs an example, you can pass `{\"50256\": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.\n",
