This can be set to `null` to turn off, in which case the client must manually trigger model response.\nServer VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.\nSemantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off with \"uhhm\", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.\n</property-description>",
